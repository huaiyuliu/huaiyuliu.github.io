    <b>Course Title:</b> Low-power Adaptive Neuromorphic Systems: Device, Circuits, Algorithms and Architectures<br /><br />
    <b>Lecture Time:</b> 14:00 - 18:00, Day1<br /><br />
    <b>Abstract:</b> The recent success of “Deep neural networks” (DNN) has renewed interest in bio-inspired machine learning algorithms. However, most work has focused on designing energy efficient circuits for inference while the learning is relegated to a server working on offline collected data. This method has drawbacks in terms of scalability of IoT as well as data non-stationarity in biomedical devices (both wearable or implantable). Hence, this tutorial describes in detail strategies to design adaptive neuromorphic systems that learn from data in an online, unsupervised or semi-supervised fashion. To reduce power dissipation and hardware resource usage, cross-layer innovations spanning novel devices (e.g. floating-gate, memristor etc), circuits (switched capacitor synapse, transposable SRAM synapse, bi-stable synapse, neuron and driver circuits etc), algorithms (Spike time dependent plasticity, Spike Time and Rate based plasticity, Least mean square, Backpropagation and variants like feedback alignment etc) and architectures (crossbar, island style etc) will be discussed. Finally, we will present some case studies of usage of adaptive neuromorphic systems in brain-machine interfaces, robotics and the internet of things.<br /><br />

    <b>Course Title:</b> Brain Inspired Computing: The Extraordinary Voyages in Known and Unknown Worlds<br /><br />
    <b>Lecture Time:</b> 14:00 - 18:00, Day1<br /><br />
    <b>Abstract:</b> Human brain is the most sophisticated organ that nature ever builds. Building a machine that can function like a human brain, indubitably, is the ultimate dream of a computer architect. Although we have not yet fully understood the working mechanism of human brains, the part that we have learned in past seventy years already guided us to many remarkable successes in computing applications, e.g., artificial neural network and machine learning. Inspired by the working mechanism of human brain, neuromorphic system naturally possesses a massively parallel architecture with closely coupled memory, offering a great opportunity to break the "memory wall" in von Neumann architecture. The talk will start with a background introduction of neuromorphic computing, followed by examples of hardware acceleration schemes of learning and neural network algorithms and memristor-based computing engine. I will also share our prospects on the future technology challenges and advances of neuromorphic computing.<br /><br />

    <b>Course Title:</b> Energy-efficient VLSI Design of Image Recognition and Machine Learning Algorithms for Automotive Applications<br /><br />
    <b>Lecture Time:</b> 9:00 - 11:00, 13:00 - 15:00, Day3<br /><br />
    <b>Abstract:</b>Nowadays, many computer-vision and machine-learning applications in portable devices such as robotics, smartphones, and autonomous vehicles are constrained by their real-time performance requirements. Meanwhile, the power consumption is also a critical factor for battery-powered systems. The VLSI design for image recognition and machine learning must take account of the processing speed and energy-efficiency simultaneously. In particular, embedded SRAM (static random-access memory) macros are important power-dissipation sources in image processing algorithms due to the high-capacitance buses and frequent accesses. To avoid the inductive bounce noise on the power supply and ground caused by large in rush/discharge currents in mode transitions of power-gating approach, in this research, a hardware-friendly algorithm with optimized SRAM utilization is developed to image recognition and machine learning algorithms. The prototype chips with energy-efficient VLSI architecture have been silicon-proved in 28/65/180nm CMOS technology with high integration density and memory-utilization efficiency for demonstrating the applicability in portable devices.<br /><br />
